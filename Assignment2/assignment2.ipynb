    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to estimate the position $ \\mathbf{p}_t $ of an agent, the same as assignment 1, but using different algorithmns. The agent moves in an indoor environment and gets information about its approximate change in position $ \\Delta \\mathbf{p}_t $ at every time-step. To model this, you may assume a linear dynamic model of the form:\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{p}_{t + 1} = \\mathbf{p}_t + \\Delta \\mathbf{p}_{t+1} + \\mathbf{w}_{t+1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{p}_t$ is a 3-dimensional position vector of the agent at time $t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\Delta \\mathbf{p}_t$ is the change in positon.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{w}_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0_{3 \\times 1}, \\mathbf{Q})$ is Gaussian white noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ \\mathbf{Q} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 3} $ is the covariance of the process noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the information of the change in position $ \\Delta \\mathbf{p}_t$ contains errors, the position estimates from the dynamic model will drift. This means that over time, the agent will lose track of where it actually is. To remedy this, the agent is carrying a magnetometer, and has a map of the magnetic field. The magnetometer samples a measurement of the magnetic field $\\mathbf{y}_t$ at every position $\\mathbf{p}_t$. The map of the magnetic field is modeled by a non-linear function: a reduced rank Gaussian process (you do not need to understand, model or change the GP model, only to call the function evaluation). This results in the non-linear measurement model:\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{y}_t = f(\\mathbf{p}_t) + \\mathbf{v}_t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{y}_t$ is a 3-dimensional measurement vector of the magnetic field at time-step $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $f(\\cdot)$ is the reduced rank Gaussian process function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{v}_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0_{3 \\times 1}, \\mathbf{R})$ is Gaussian white noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ \\mathbf{R} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 3} $ is the covariance of the measurement noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### First load in the data\n",
    "To start, first load in the data below\n",
    "All variables you will use are numpy arrays, where\n",
    "- `magnetometerMeasurements` $\\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times \\text{T}}$ is a numpy array containing the magnetometer measurements\n",
    "- `magnetometerInitialPosition` $\\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 1}$ is a numpy array containing the initial position of the magnetometer\n",
    "- `deltaMagnetometerPositions` $\\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times \\text{T}}$ is a numpy array containing the change in position of the magnetometer\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Warning\n",
    "- Additionally you are provided with a dictionary modelParameters which is used in creating magnetic field maps. DO NOT CHANGE dictionary as this might break the assignment. To create the EKF and UKF you DO NOT need this dictionary."
